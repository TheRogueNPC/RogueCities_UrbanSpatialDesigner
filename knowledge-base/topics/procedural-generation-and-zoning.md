# Procedural Generation and Zoning (Tensor to District Pipeline)

City output is generated through a staged pipeline that starts from user axioms and tensor fields, then traces roads, classifies frontage/district characteristics, and applies lot and site generation logic.

## Core Pipeline Concepts
- Tensor field guidance for road structure
- Streamline tracing and road graph processing
- AESP-driven district classification
- Lot and site generation stages
