// This file is intended to centralize all responsive layout logic for the UI, including viewport resizing, dynamic docking adjustments, and adaptive UI scaling. It should provide utility functions and constants that can be used across the entire UI codebase to ensure consistent behavior and simplify maintenance. This will help us manage edge cases like extreme aspect ratios, multi-monitor setups, and user-driven resizing more effectively, while keeping the main UI code clean and focused on rendering and interaction logic.

// COCKPIT DOCTRINE: Robustness, user-friendly resizing, edge case handling, and consistent responsive behavior across all UI components.
