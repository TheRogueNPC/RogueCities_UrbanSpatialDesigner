// This file serves as a central header for all UI-related tokens and definitions used in the visualizer module. It should include any necessary headers from the ui/ directory that define constants, enums, and other tokens that are shared across multiple UI components. This helps to keep the code organized and ensures that all UI components have access to the necessary definitions without needing to include multiple headers individually. It should not contain any implementation code or definitions that are specific to a single component, as those should be defined in their respective headers and source files to maintain separation of concerns and avoid ODR violations.
//todo ensure that this file only contains declarations and definitions that are truly shared across multiple UI components, and that any component-specific tokens or definitions are kept in their own headers to maintain modularity and prevent unnecessary coupling between components. This file should be the single source of truth for any UI tokens that need to be accessed globally, and should be included by any UI component that requires access to those tokens.
