# Docs Index (Reorganized)

This is the new canonical documentation layout.

## Core Sections
- `docs/20_specs` - Stable program specs, architecture references, guides.
- `docs/30_architecture` - Architecture diagrams/maps.
- `docs/40_implementation_completed` - Completed phase work, fixes, release summaries.
- `docs/41_plans_todos` - Planned work, TODOs, checklists, roadmaps.
- `docs/50_testing` - Testing docs and test guides.
- `docs/60_operations` - Operational references.

## Most Important For Verification
- `docs/41_plans_todos` (this is the clean TODO/planning bucket)
- See: `docs/00_index/plans-and-todos-index.md`
- UI compliance baseline: `docs/20_specs/ui-faq-compliance-matrix.md`

## Archived Legacy Material
- `docs/90_archive/stubs_and_duplicates` - Duplicate/stub files (including `(2)` variants).
- `docs/90_archive/legacy_temp` - Legacy folder structure and miscellaneous historical docs.
- `docs/generated/doxygen` - Generated docs output.

## Notes
- Empty/low-value duplicate variants were moved out of active docs.
- Legacy top-level folders (`Intergration Notes`, `Progam_Specs`, `temp_Documentation`, etc.) were moved under archive.
