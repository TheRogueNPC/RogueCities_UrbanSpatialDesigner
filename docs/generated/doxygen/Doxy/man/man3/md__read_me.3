.SH "Abstract"
.PP
Cities function as \fBcomplex adaptive systems\fP formed through the interplay of decentralized bottom-up self-organization and centralized top-down planning interventions\&. \fBRogue City Designer\fP is a procedural generation framework that models this duality through:

.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fBTensor field axioms\fP encoding top-down planning intent (radial, grid, organic)
.IP "2." 4
\fBAESP-based district emergence\fP from road network topology (Access, Exposure, Serviceability, Privacy)
.IP "3." 4
\fBMulti-scale street analysis\fP using persistent homology and grid quality metrics
.IP "4." 4
\fBLayered graph support\fP for bridges, tunnels, and grade-separated infrastructure
.PP

.PP
Unlike traditional square-grid generators, this system produces \fBcoherent, believable urban environments\fP ranging from rigid Manhattan-style grids to organic European networks, based on axiom configuration and urban complexity principles\&.

.PP
.PP
.SH "Research Foundation"
.PP
.SS "Urban Complexity Framework"
Cities exhibit **organized complexity**—a balance between chaos (overstimulation, incoherence) and order (sterility, monotony)\&. The framework evaluates this balance through:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBNetwork Density\fP: Nodes, intersections, edges per unit area
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBNetwork Resilience\fP: Functionality under disruption (blocked streets, damage)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBNetwork Connectedness\fP: Path diversity, permeability, routing options
.PP
.SS "Grid Quality Metrics"
The generator evaluates street networks using a \fBcomposite grid index\fP balancing four components:
.SS "1\&. Straightness (ς)"
$$\\varsigma = \\frac{\\text{average great-circle distance}}{\\text{average segment length}}$$

.PP
Measures how closely streets approximate straight lines, affecting navigation efficiency and visual coherence\&.
.SS "2\&. Orientation Order (Φ)"
Analyzes internal consistency of street orientations through:
.IP "1." 4
Calculate bidirectional compass bearings of every street
.IP "2." 4
Compute street orientation entropy
.IP "3." 4
Normalize as orientation order indicator
.PP

.PP
High order → consistent grid patterns (Manhattan) 
.br
 Low order → organic networks (medieval European)
.SS "3\&. Terrain Adaptation"
Evaluates variance and inconsistency as roads adapt to slopes, elevation changes, and natural obstacles\&.
.SS "4\&. Four-Way Intersection Proportion (I)"
$$I = \\frac{\\text{four-way intersections}}{\\text{total intersections}}$$

.PP
Tracks the share of nodes that are four-way junctions, influencing traffic flow and grid character\&.

.PP
\fBComposite Grid Index:\fP

.PP
$$\\text{GridIndex} = (\\varsigma \\times \\Phi \\times I)^{1/3}$$

.PP
The geometric mean ensures non-compensatory aggregation—poor performance in any component significantly impacts the final score\&.

.SH "District Classification"
.PP
The generator converts \fBFrontage Profiles (AESP)\fP into \fBdistrict-type affinities\fP using weighted formulas reflecting urban planning principles:
.SS "District Type Formulas"
.SS "1\&. Mixed-Use: 0\&.25(A + E + S + P) — Balanced"
.IP "\(bu" 2

.PP
.SS "2\&. Residential: 0\&.60P + 0\&.20A + 0\&.10S + 0\&.10E — Privacy-dominant"

.PP
.SS "5\&. Industrial: 0\&.60S + 0\&.25A + 0\&.10E + 0\&.05P — Serviceability-dominant"

.PP
.SS "Practical Application"
When processing a parcel, the lot generator:
.IP "1." 4
Queries nearest road type using distance-to-segment calculations
.IP "2." 4
Retrieves road's frontage profile (A, E, S, P values)
.IP "3." 4
Applies district formulas to generate affinity scores
.IP "4." 4
Combines with axiom biases and influencer landmarks
.IP "5." 4
Uses classification to inform building height, setback, density, ground-floor use
.PP

.PP
\fBEmergent Result\fP: Buildings along highways exhibit industrial/commercial characteristics (high service, low privacy), while cul-de-sacs spawn residential structures (high privacy, low exposure)\&.

.PP
.PP
.SH "Multi-Level City Support"
.PP
.SS "Layered Graph Representation"
For cities with bridges, tunnels, and elevated structures, the system uses \fBlayered graphs\fP:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBG = (V, E)\fP: Piecewise-linear graph embedded in ℝ²
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBℓ : E → ℕ\fP: Layer assignment oracle
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBLᵢ = ℓ⁻¹(i)\fP: Set of edges on layer i
.PP
.SS "Portals"
A \fBportal\fP is a vertex shared by ≥2 layers (edges adjacent belong to different layers)\&. Conceptually, there are \fRm\fP copies of ℝ², one per layer, glued together at portals\&. This layered space is denoted \fBL\fP\&.

.PP
\fBKey Innovation\fP: All computational steps occur within the multi-layer space \fBL\fP, using portal-aware distance calculations\&. This ensures topological signatures and distance measurements account for bridges/tunnels rather than artificially flattening the network\&.
