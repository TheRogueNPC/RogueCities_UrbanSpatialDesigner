# Phase 4 Deferral Note

Date: 2026-02-11

- Full Phase 4 export pipeline expansion is intentionally deferred.
- Current implementation focus remains on Phase 5 (CPU/SIMD baseline) and Phase 6 (editor integration + minimap LOD).
- Golden texture hash replay validation is already present and remains part of the acceptance path for later Phase 4 completion.
