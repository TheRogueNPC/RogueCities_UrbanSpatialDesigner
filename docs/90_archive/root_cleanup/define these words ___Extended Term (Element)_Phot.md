Here are definitions for the requested terms, categorized for clarity:

---

### **General Concepts**

- **Extended Term (Element):** Likely refers to an expanded or advanced concept of an "element," possibly in a scientific or metaphysical context. In science, an element is a fundamental substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.
- **Photon:** A quantum of electromagnetic energy, representing the smallest discrete unit of light and other electromagnetic radiation. It is massless and travels at the speed of light[^7][^8].
- **Reon:** While not a standard scientific term, it has cultural meanings such as "descendant of the king" or "spirit/strength" in some contexts[^15][^16].

---

### **Descriptive Terms**

- **Nuance:** A subtle or slight difference in meaning, expression, or tone[^22][^23].
- **Aspect:** A particular part or feature of something; also refers to the direction a surface faces[^29][^30].
- **Strata:** Layers of material, such as sedimentary rock, often used metaphorically to describe levels in other contexts[^37][^38].
- **Facet:** A distinct feature or aspect of something; also refers to the flat surfaces on a cut gemstone[^43][^44].

---

### **Physical and Abstract Properties**

- **Cohesion:** The act or state of sticking together, often used to describe molecular attraction in physics or unity in social contexts[^51][^57].
- **Network:** A system of interconnected elements, such as nodes linked by pathways.
- **Disgregation:** The process of breaking apart or separating into smaller components.
- **Order:** A state of organized structure or arrangement.
- **Chaos:** A state of complete disorder and unpredictability.

---

### **Conceptual and Philosophical Terms**

- **Matrix:** An environment or structure within which something develops; also used in mathematics and computing.
- **Force:** A physical influence that causes an object to move, change shape, or experience stress.
- **Spirit:** The non-material essence of a being; often associated with vitality or consciousness.
- **Body:** The physical structure of an organism.

---

### **Singularities and Energies**

- **Singularity:** A point where conventional rules break down, such as infinite density in black holes.
- **Ether (Energy):** Historically considered a medium for light propagation; now metaphorical for an unseen energy field.
- **Psyche (Coherence):** Refers to the human soul, mind, or spirit in coherence with itself.
- **Soma (Stabilizing Lattice):** The physical body as a stabilizing framework.

---

### **Elemental Forces**

- **Void (Entropy):** The absence of matter; associated with disorder or randomness (entropy).
- **Nova (Fire):** A stellar explosion; metaphorically linked to fire and creation.
- **Aqua (Water):** Represents fluidity and adaptability.
- **Terra (Earth):** Symbolizes stability and grounding.
- **Elatos (Metal/Flexibility/Clay):** Suggests strength combined with adaptability.
- **Squall (Wind):** Represents sudden force or change.
- **Arc (Lightning):** Symbolizes energy and illumination.
- **Systole (Condensing Gravity):** Refers to contraction under gravitational forces.

---

### **Natural and Universal Principles**

- **Fysi (Nature):** Represents the essence of natural phenomena.
- **Quantum (Exponential):** Refers to discrete quantities that exhibit exponential growth in certain contexts.
- **Omni (All-Encompassing):** Denotes universality or inclusivity.

---

### **Life Cycle Concepts**

- **Vitalis (Life/Death/Birth/Limbo):** Encompasses the fundamental states of existence.
    - *Birth:* The beginning of life.
    - *Life:* The active state of existence.
    - *Death:* The cessation of life functions.
