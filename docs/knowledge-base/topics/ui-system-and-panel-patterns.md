The UI layer uses token-based wrappers and panel conventions to keep style and behavior consistent, while a compliance checker enforces migration away from raw per-panel styling patterns.

## Focus Areas
- Token panel wrappers and dockable windows
- Semantic UI text and preset management
- Migration rules and automated compliance checks
